                             SECTION 2: GOVERNMENT PRACTICES
Government in the United States of America is the collective will of the people in a
democratic society, working together to secure and improve the lives of all persons. All
participants should be confident that the fundamental processes of election, appointment,
legislation, administration, and enforcement are sound and faithfully adhered to.

•   We support transparency and accountability in government at all levels including
    adherence to all public meeting and open government laws.
•   We support applying open meeting laws to every level and branch of government.
•   We support the enforcement of ethics and conduct standards for all elected officials,
    public employees, and government contractors.
•   We oppose for-profit privatization of public services (i.e., Social Security, Medicare,
    Medicaid, education, prisons, the military) including outsourcing veterans’ healthcare
    scheduling.
•   We believe all physical and digital public records of deliberations, votes, and decisions
    made at every level of government should be made available for public review.
•   We support electronic voting in the Wyoming State Legislature or recording these
    votes for public review.
