Sheridan County Democrats recognize that we are global citizens and have a role to play
in promoting peace and prosperity across the globe. We must recognize and understand
the legitimate interests of other nations, their histories, and cultures, in the spirit of seeking
how to work collectively to resolve problems. We urge the same commitment to
democracy, self-determination, open government, civil and human rights, and the rule of law
in our conduct of foreign affairs as we espouse at home.

•   We support diplomacy as the priority in international relations and we support restoring
    peaceful, cooperative, and collaborative relationships with other nations that promote
    the principles of freedom, human rights, and compassion.
•   We support withdrawal of U.S. troops and all private military forces presently hired by the
    U.S. government from any foreign countries where they are not welcomed by their citizens.
•   We support cutting our military budget and dissolving the budgetary line item known as
    the OCO (Overseas Contingency Operations) line item and redirecting those resources to
    human needs and job creation and training for all citizens, including our veterans.
•    We support the closure of the Western Hemisphere Institute for Security Cooperation at Ft.
     Benning, GA, formerly known as “School of the Americas”.
•    We support “H.R. 1111 (117th Congress): Department of Peacebuilding Act of 2021” which
     would establish a cabinet level position to direct efforts to support peace and nonviolence
     as national policy.
•    We support humanitarian aid to other nations and peoples.
•    We believe in restoring the constitutional authority of Congress to declare war and
     authorize policing or defensive military actions against other nations and peoples.
•    We support the repeal of the 2002 Iraq Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF).
•    We support the permanent closure of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
•    We support a reduction of resources expended on militarism.
•    We support the U.S. once again taking an active role in nuclear disarmament.
