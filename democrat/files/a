PREAMBLE

We hold these truths to be self-evident, that
all men are created equal, that they are
endowed by their Creator with certain
unalienable Rights, that among these are
Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.
―Preamble to the Declaration of Independence

We the People of the United States, in Order
to form a more perfect Union, establish
Justice, insure domestic Tranquility, provide
for the common defense, promote the
general Welfare, and secure the Blessings of
Liberty to ourselves and our Posterity, do
ordain and establish this Constitution for
the United States of America.
―Preamble to the Constitution


Democrats will fight to repair the soul of this
nation. To unite and to heal our country. To
turn this crisis into a crucible, from which we
will forge a stronger, brighter, and more
equitable future.

We must right the wrongs in our
democracy, redress the systemic injustices
that have long plagued our society, throw
open the doors of opportunity for all
Americans, and reinvent our institutions at
home and our leadership abroad. We do not
simply aspire to return our country to where
we were four years ago. We know we must
be bolder and more ambitious.
―Democratic Party Platform 2020
