                  SECTION 7: PUBLIC LANDS, CONSERVATION, AND THE ENVIRONMENT

    Wyoming is known for the beauty of our diverse and dramatic natural environments.
    Our access to public lands and spaces is unique, and Sheridan County Democrats
    recognize the importance of conserving wildlife, wildlands, and our rich legacy of
    connecting with the environment. We believe that Wyoming’s travel, wildlife, and
    outdoor recreation sector is vital to our way of life and economy. We believe that
    providing quality jobs and protecting the environment are not mutually exclusive goals.

•   We recognize that federal lands belong to all Americans and we oppose any efforts to
    transfer management of public lands to the state or any other entity.
•   We believe that any lands acquired by the State of Wyoming should be managed for
    the long-term benefit of all people, wildlife, and the environment.
•   We support accountability in the collection of income from state or federal lands, and
    public notice for sales, swaps or leasing of public lands.
•   We support a common-sense option that benefits ranchers to willingly retire their
    grazing permits.
•   We oppose aerial spraying of herbicide on public lands in order to protect and maintain
    biodiversity.
•   We support the creation of statewide programs for the recycling of all reusable materials,
    industrial use of biodegradable materials, and mandatory deposits for all beverage
    containers; we advocate for the elimination of single-use plastics.
•   We support maintaining a diverse energy portfolio and emphasizing the importance of
    renewable energy and energy efficiency in economic growth and sustainability.
•   We urge subsidies for efficient, alternative commercial and home energy, and we support
    requiring that all new construction or renovation benefitting from public funding be
    completed with energy efficiency and active and passive solar design features where
    feasible.
•   We support the right of all persons to participate in residential renewable energy,
    including community solar.
•   We oppose any efforts to curtail net metering.
•   We support small farming and ranching operations in Wyoming and sustainable,
    regenerative agricultural practices.
•   We believe local food production and distribution is a tangible opportunity for economic
    development in our communities. We support increasing the availability of home-grown
    products in our communities through encouraging young farmer start-up programs and
    other educational and training opportunities.
•   We support the concept and practice of Country-of-Origin Labeling (COOL).
•   We support labeling of food containing genetic modifications to preserve the public’s ability
    to make informed choices. We oppose GMOs that transfer ownership of living organisms
    from the public domain to corporations.
•   We support the enforcement of environmental protection laws that reduce pollution
    and ensure the clean air and water across Wyoming and the nation.
•   We support actions which lead the United States to participate in global initiatives to
    combat climate change and the spread of emerging diseases.
