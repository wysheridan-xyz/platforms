GUIDING PRINCIPLES

The Sheridan County Democratic Party seeks to
ensure that all people enjoy the unalienable rights of
life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness guaranteed
by our U.S. Constitution. We are dedicated to ensuring
that every person—regardless of race, ethnicity, color,
religion, gender, sexual orientation, ability, and
political affiliation—has a voice in how we are
governed. We work for equality, domestic tranquility,
the common defense, the general welfare, and liberty.

Our democracy is facing a perilous moment in our
country’s history. As divisiveness increases,
communication and cooperation to collectively solve
major problems decreases. Sheridan Democrats
embrace civil discourse. We are passionate about the
pursuit of dialogue and solutions. We pledge to do
whatever it takes to build bridges across the growing
divide, to listen and try to understand all sides. The
most pressing priority we see today is to safeguard
democracy and to remain United We Stand.

We envision a Wyoming in which all people are
treated with respect and dignity. A state in which
every person has access to justice, housing,
healthcare, an adequate wage, quality public
education, arts and culture, public lands, a healthy
environment, and fair and free elections.

As Democrats—and more importantly, as citizens of
this state, nation, and world—we pledge to work
together to make this vision a reality now and in years
to come.
