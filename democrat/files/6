                        SECTION 6: ECONOMY, EMPLOYMENT, AND TAXES
To achieve prosperity and enhance the health of our economy, Sheridan County
Democrats promote policies and practices that protect workers’ safety and rights, cultivate
economic diversity, and consider important tax reforms. Besides promoting equity, this
would stimulate the economy by increasing money in circulation used for purchasing
goods and services.

•   We support the right of employees to organize and enter into collective bargaining.
•   We believe that quality job creation should be promoted by public development and

•   We support access to affordable, licensed childcare services.
•   We support equal pay for equal work.
•   We support wide-ranging efforts to promote economic diversity, opportunity, and a
    stable economy in Wyoming, including working towards a “just transition” for displaced
    workers in the fossil fuels extraction and development sector through education and
    re-training programs.
•   We support a minimum living wage of $15/hour for all workers, including "Tip Workers."
•   We believe that retirement income and pensions should be protected in the event of
    corporate restructuring or bankruptcy.
•   We support policies to create diverse work environments and increase opportunities
    for underemployed and disadvantaged populations.
•   We support safe working conditions and standards for workers in Wyoming.
•   We support preservation of the U.S. Social Security System.
•   We support an adequately funded U.S. Postal Service.
•   We support equitable and proportional taxation including corporate, investment and
    personal income tax in Wyoming.
