Our country was built on immigration – by immigrants. Today, it continues to weave a rich
tapestry of diversity that improves and enhances our communities. Sheridan County
Democrats appreciate and welcome those who choose to come to this country and to
Wyoming.

•   We support long-term solutions to the conflicts and economic problems that have led
    to the global movement of economic refugees.
•   We support immigration and advocate for an immigration system that processes
    prospective immigrants in a timely and just manner and provides a clear and consistent
    path to citizenship.
•   We oppose the continuation of construction of a wall on the U.S. Southern border or
    anywhere else.
•   We support keeping immigrant families together and strongly oppose the separation
    of children from parents.
•   We support a path to citizenship for individuals referred to as DACA or Dreamers.
•   We oppose building private prisons and Immigration and Customs Enforcement
    facilities in Wyoming.
•   We oppose any efforts to deny immigrants health care and human services, education,
    or access to justice.
