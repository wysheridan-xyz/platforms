The Sheridan County Democratic Party would like to recognize the work, contributions, and
accomplishments of the following individuals, groups, and organizations:

•    The nurses, doctors, and health care workers of this nation who are fighting on the front
     lines of the COVID-19 Pandemic.
•    All emergency responders, firefighters, and police officers who serve our communities.
•    We support the public workers’ unions that have stood up against legislative attacks on
     collective bargaining rights, benefits, and pensions.
•    The members of the armed forces—both current and foreign—for their willingness to
     serve our nation.
•    Democrats holding office at every level of government who are advocating for the
     principles of our party, fighting for the least among us, and continuing to represent the
     interests of their constituents with integrity and statesmanship—especially those in
     Wyoming.
