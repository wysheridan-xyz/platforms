       “Liberty without Learning is always in peril and Learning without Liberty is always in vain.”
                                                                                       ― John F. Kennedy

Sheridan County Democrats believe robust investment in a strong and diverse public
education system is essential for individual success and responsible citizenship. We
support Wyoming’s constitutional mandate that higher education be “as nearly free” as
possible.

•   We support equal access to fully funded public education from Pre-K through college
    and/or trade school.
•   We support the right of all students to participate in public school regardless of race,
    color, sex, sexual orientation, gender expression or identity, ethnicity, religion, age,
    disability, national origin, or other personal identity.
•   We support inclusion of vocational training in our public education system.
•   We support inclusion of early childhood education in our public education system.
•   We believe in the principles of life-long learning, and we support funding for a robust
    Continuing Education system across the state in community colleges, libraries, and
    other institutions.
•   We believe that all persons deserve and benefit from having free access to the arts and
    humanities in their communities. We support funding for public media, the visual,
    performing, and literary arts, and public libraries, and we encourage the Wyoming
    Humanities and Arts Councils to develop additional public/private initiatives to fund and
    develop local arts and humanities programs.
•   We support the right of educators to negotiate collectively and participate in the
    certification process to ensure a high standard of quality in teaching and learning.
•   We believe the University of Wyoming, Trustees, and President, should adhere to the
    Wyoming Constitution, follow open meeting laws, and ensure that the University remains
    independent of political influence.
•   We support promotion of the humanities, creative arts, social and natural sciences, civic
    and government studies, technology, mathematics, and formal sciences at all
    educational levels and institutions.
•   We oppose teaching “alternative science” that lacks a scientific base of fact or theory.
•   We support cultivating a safe environment for students, faculty, and staff including
    enforcement of comprehensive anti-bullying and tolerance programs; we oppose
    arming any school employees.
•   We support separation of church and state within the school system and we oppose
    requiring student participation in any religious activity that places the burden of refusal
    on the student.
•   We support academic programs and curricula at all levels that promote and cultivate
    the principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion, and we oppose educational “gag
    orders” intended to prohibit, alter, or curtail such programs and curricula.
•   We recognize that local and state Boards of Education are charged with primary
    oversight of academic curricula, and we oppose external efforts, including undue
    parental interference, to alter or constrain a teacher’s methods and lesson plans.
•   We support a parent’s right and responsibility to be involved in their child’s education
    and their choice to seek other options if public education does not align with their
    viewpoint.
•   We support the creation of a student loan debt relief program for outstanding loans.
•   We support structuring future student loans to remain affordable.
