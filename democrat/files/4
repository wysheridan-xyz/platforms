Sheridan County Democrats recognize that accessible, quality health care is a basic,
universal human right and not a privilege. Comprehensive health care must cover all types
of treatment from birth to the end of life, including: medical, dental, vision, mental health
including substance abuse, women’s health, reproductive health care according to
personal choice, preventive health care, pediatric health and other health care needs of
Wyomingites.
