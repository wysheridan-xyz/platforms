Liberty
9.
    • Liberty is indivisible from economic freedom. 
    • The free market economy is the economic system most compatible with the requirements of personal freedom and constitutional government. 
    • Government’s undue interference in the market, as well as the fiscal irresponsibility of government, results in economic inequity. 
    • There exists no fundamental right to the fruits of another person’s labor.
