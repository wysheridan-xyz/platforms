Religious Freedom
6.
    • The freedom to practice one’s faith is a fundamental natural right secured by our Constitution. 
    • The First Amendment does not require the expulsion of religion from public life. 
    • We must keep in mind the Judaeo-Christian principles of the Founding Fathers when they wrote it; the practice of faith under this tradition encourages good moral behavior and the development of character that helps secure the other fundamental bases of our national citizenship. 
    • Freedom of religion includes the right to abstain from actions contrary to one’s religious beliefs.
